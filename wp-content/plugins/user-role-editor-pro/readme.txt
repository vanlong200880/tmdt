== Changelog ==
= 4.14.4 =
* 04.08.2014
* Fix for: PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: user_role_editor in user-role-editor-pro.php on line 69 introduced in version 4.14.2. If automatic updates feature was broken for you for that reason, update to this version manually.
* Integration with Gravity Forms permissions system was updated for admin menu blocking module.

= 4.14.3 =
* 25.07.2014
* Integer "1" as default capability value for new added empty role was excluded for the better compatibility with WordPress core. Boolean "true" is used instead as WordPress itself does.
* Integration with Gravity Forms permissions system was enhanced for WordPress multisite.
* Roles import module may import role with integer (not boolean) capability value "1". Error was shown earlier. 
* Error message from import roles module shows role and capability which does not pass the validation rule.

= 4.14.2 =
* 24.07.2014
* Admin menu access module: 
  - Bug was fixed which prevented to prohibit direct URL access to the blocked menu items. Recheck roles blocked admin menu items after installing this update as with low probability you may need to redefine them from the scratch. Try to deactivate/activate plugin 1st (Network deactivate/Network Activate for WP multisite). Generally it helps according to the test results;
  - role menu permissions processing was updated for the Gravity Forms plugin under WP multisite.
* Integration with Gravity Forms permissions system was enhanced for WP multisite.
* MySQL query optimized in order to reduce memory consumption.
* Extra WordPress nonce field was removed from the post at main role editor page.
* The instance of main plugin class User_Role_Editor is available for other developers via $GLOBALS['user_role_editor']
* Compatibility issue with the theme ["WD TechGoStore"](http://wpdance.com) is resolved. This theme loads its JS and CSS stuff for admin backend unconditionally - for all pages except loading for its own pages only. 
While the problem is caused just by CSS, URE unloads for optimization purpose all this theme's JS and CSS from WP admin backend pages where conflict is possible.

* Minor code enhancements.


= 4.12.1 =
* 01.07.2014
* Technical update to fix the issue with the automatic updates API link. This link should start from https://www.role-editor.com instead of https://role-editor.com
This is related to migration or role-editor.com to the Google App Engine platform, which does not support SSL for the naked custom domains and 
force us SSL secured links from www subdomain, e.g. https://www.role-editor.com in our case.


= 4.12 =
* 22.04.2014
* Use new "Admin Menu" button to block selected admin menu items for role. You need to activate this module at the "Additional Modules".

You may use "Admin Menu" dialog as the reference for your work with roles and capabilities as "Admin Menu" shows 
what user capability restrict access to what admin menu item.
* Posts/Pages edit restriction feature does not prohibit to add new post/page now. Now it should be managed via 'create_posts' or 'create_pages' user capabilities.
* If you use Posts/Pages edit restriction by author IDs, there is no need to add user ID to allow him edit his own posts or page. Current user is added to the allowed authors list automatically.
* New tab "Additional Modules" was added to the User Role Editor options page. As per name all options related to additional modules were moved there.
